-- I decided to make Elm the main (first) project language for this project (ZooTree) as this project is about a game that is about trees, and it only makes sense to dedicate a language like Elm to it (since Elm is also named after a tree) this project needs a language file, so it works. I wanted to write this game in Elm as a challenge, and to further support the language. The main Linux version will be written in Elm. Other platforms will be written in other languages
